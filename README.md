### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a Computer Programming Student working on improving my skills in fullstack web development and game development. In the Summer of 2022, I learned how to utilize Typescript in the React Framework and how to use Redis, GraphQl, PostgreSQL's for backend web developement. My study of web development culminated in the development of a simple forum web application: https://github.com/weter123/Online-Forum

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:
    - ASP.NET
    - Cloud computing.
    - Unreal Engine 5.
